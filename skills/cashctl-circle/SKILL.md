description: Join a circle to get a personal Lightning wallet (`cashctl join`, aliasing `cashctl circle create`), the self-service call into a Circle Hub's create_circle_wallet. Use when handed a circlehub1... connection string (or a raw NWC URI for a Hub that hasn't adopted the bech32 form) and asked to join/onboard/get a wallet from it.

# cashctl join / cashctl circle create

```sh
cashctl join --hub circlehub1... --max-amount 100000 --json
```

`join` is a top-level shortcut for `cashctl circle create` — identical flags
and behavior, just the verb a member actually thinks in ("join a circle")
rather than the wire method's own name (`create_circle_wallet`). Both
forms work identically; prefer `join`.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--hub` (required) | the Circle Hub connection: `circlehub1...` (recommended) or a raw NWC URI |
| `--max-amount` | requested spend cap, in mloki |
| `--expiry` | requested expiry duration (`0` = the Hub's own default) |
| `--budget-renewal` | `daily`\|`weekly`\|`monthly`\|`yearly`\|`never` (default: the Hub's own) |
| `--as` | override credential — `pubkey:<privkey>` (the only NIP-CW credential mode); defaults to your local identity |

```sh
# {"wallet": "circle:<label-or-n>", "default": true, "response": {...}}
cashctl join --hub circlehub1... --max-amount 100000 --json
```

A `--hub` value that's actually a **Cash Hub** connection (`cashhub1...`)
gets a specific corrective error (`code: "invalid_input"`) — cashctl can't
mint, and joining isn't the right verb for a Cash Hub anyway. The
resulting personal wallet is saved to your wallet inventory under a
generated name and set as your default if it's your first-ever wallet
(`--json` always accepts the default-wallet prompt; text mode asks unless
`--yes`).

There is no `circle leave`/`circle list` — a circle membership is just an
ordinary registered wallet from this point on (`cashctl wallet show`,
`cashctl connect rm <name>` to drop it).
